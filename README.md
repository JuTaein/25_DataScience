- Voice-based Emotion Prediction (ML)
- Problem Definition: Develop an ML model to predict a person's emotions from a short voice recording.

- Technologies Used:
  Speech Feature Extraction: openSMILE 
  Models: SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, etc., with performance comparison.
  Text Tokenization: Okt or MeCab
  Dataset: [Conversational Voice Dataset for Emotion Classification] : https://aihub.or.kr/aihubdata/data/view.do?dataSetSn=263

- Advantages:
  Relatively lightweight and clear application of ML is possible.
  The project workflow is well-defined, from preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

- Evaluation:
  Utilize ML metrics such as F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.
